Multi-Dimensional Vision (MDV) lab is led by Prof. Di Lin. People in the lab study the computer vision tasks from different dimensions, focusing on the analysis of 2D/3D data and multi-modality information, for object recognition and scene understanding in different applications. Recently, our work mainly lies in 2D/3D semantic segmentation for natural image, point cloud completion/segmentation, human pose estimation, language-assisted vision, semantic image repairing, and medical image analysis.

We are recruiting self-motivated students to join MDV lab and work on the interesting vision topics. Should you feel interested, please send a message along with your CV to Prof. Di Lin (Email address: Ande.lin1988@gmail.com).
